# FoleyMono
## Meritory undergraduate thesis for graduating as a Sound Engineer.

# Conditional Wasserstein GAN developed to generate knocks {wood, metal, glass} and steps {wood, concrete, water}.

3 Different available models with different sampling rate:
- 8 kHz
* 16 kHz
+ 32 kHz (Can only generate steps on water)

Instructions will be shown through the Jupyter notebook in Colab. <br />

# If you'd like to dissect the project:

Most of this project was hardcoded to train the models locally and eventually used to generate through Google Colab with the trained models, which means that all the data processing steps and folder locations will be hardcoded to work under specific conditions, however, valuable information can be extracted from the notebooks if you follow along with the document for the thesis since you will be able to see the code implementation for the theory being explained.Â
